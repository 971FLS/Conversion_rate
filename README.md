# Conversion_rate
Project Conversion rate was realized for a bootcamp challenge

# Objectives

## Company's Description ðŸ“‡

www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !
Project ðŸš§

The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.
Goals ðŸŽ¯

# Steps
    * Part 1 : EDA, preprocessings and train a baseline model
    * Part 2 : improvement of the model's f1-score with feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...
    * Part 3 : With the best model, predictions with the file data_test.csv.
    Part 4 : Result given by the jury.

# Results
The jury received my file of predictions (). At the end of the challenge, my score was : 

    * F1 score : 0,754615
    * Precision : 0,845499
    * Recall : 0,681373

Not bad compared to the best model of the challenge 

    * F1 score : 0,758368
    * Precision : 0,812780
    * Recall : 0,710784
